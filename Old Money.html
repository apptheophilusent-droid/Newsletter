        <h1> Introduction: The Quiet Power of Politeness</h1>
        <p>In a world increasingly defined by speed, spectacle, and self-promotion, the concept of etiquette may seem quaint—if not obsolete. Yet among families with generational wealth, often referred to as "old money," etiquette remains a cornerstone of identity, influence, and legacy. Far from being a superficial set of rules, it is a deeply ingrained cultural code that shapes behavior, relationships, and social standing. For old money, etiquette is not just taught—it is lived.</p>
        
        <h1>Historical Roots: From Aristocracy to American Elite</h1>
        <p>Old money etiquette traces its lineage to European aristocracy, where manners were synonymous with nobility. These customs crossed the Atlantic with early American elites, evolving into a distinct social code that emphasized discretion, restraint, and propriety⁽¹⁾. Unlike the nouveau riche, who often signal wealth through conspicuous consumption, old money families have long preferred understated elegance and quiet confidence.</p>
        
        <h1> Education in Elegance: How Etiquette Is Taught</h1>
        <p>Etiquette in old money circles is rarely taught in formal classrooms. Instead, it is absorbed through immersion:<br>
       -Modeling Behavior: Children observe parents and grandparents engaging in refined conversation, hosting guests with grace, and navigating social situations with poise.<br>
       - Elite Schooling: Prestigious institutions, often Ivy League or boarding schools, reinforce social norms and cultivate networks where etiquette is expected⁽²⁾.<br>
       - Mentorship: Older relatives and family friends serve as informal mentors, correcting missteps and reinforcing standards through lived example.</p>
         
       <h1>Daily Practices: The Rituals of Refinement</h1>
       <p>Old money etiquette manifests in everyday life through subtle but powerful habits:
          PracticeDescription Conversation Polite, measured, and rarely about money. Status is implied, not declared⁽³⁾. Dress Understated luxury—bespoke tailoring, heirloom jewelry, and timeless style⁽³⁾. Dining Mastery of table manners, from utensil placement to hosting etiquette⁽¹⁾. Home Life Cultivated spaces with classical décor, quiet hospitality, and long-term staff⁽³⁾</p>
